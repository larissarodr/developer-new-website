# Developer Software Website

This is a personal project where I built the website for a Software Development company based in Brazil.

The frontend was built with React.JS (based on create-react-app) and the backend in Node.JS.

In order to run the frontend:
```
yarn start
```

The application listens port 3000.

Important: the backend is not being referenced by the frontend as the company's infrastructure couldn't handle Node. However, for future reference, I've decided to leave the backend code here.
